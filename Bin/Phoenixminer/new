2. Features, requirements, and limitations

* Supports AMD Vega, 580/570/480/470, 460/560, Fury, 390/290 and older AMD GPUs with enough VRAM
* Supports Nvidia 10x0 and 9x0 series as well as older cards with enough VRAM
* Highly optimized OpenCL and CUDA cores for maximum ethash mining speed
* Lowest developer fee of 0.65% (35 seconds defvee mining per each 90 minutes)
* Advanced statistics: actual difficulty of each share as well as effective hashrate at the pool
* DAG file generation in the GPU for faster start-up and DAG epoch switches
* Supports all ethash mining pools and stratum protocols
* Detailed statistics, including the individual cards hashrate, shares, temperature and fan speed
* Unlimited number of fail-over pools in epools.txt configuration file (or two on the command line)
* GPU tuning for the AMD GPUs to achieve maximum performance with your rig
* Supports devfee on alternative ethash currencies like ETC, EXP, Music, UBQ, Pirl, Ellaism, and Metaverse ETP. This allows you to use older cards with small VRAM or low hashate on current DAG epochs (e.g. GTX970).
* Full compatibility with the industry standard Claymore's Dual Ethereum miner, including most of command-line options, configuration files, and remote monitoring and management.
* More features coming soon!

PhoenixMiner requires Windows x64 (Windows 7, Windows 10, etc.). We are planning a Linux version in
the future but it may take some time.

PhenixMiner does not support dual mining. However we are working on this feature and will introduce it
soon. Solo mining is not supported too as we feel that it is not very practical with the current
mining difficulty.

While the miner is running, you can use some interactive commands. Press the key 'h' while the
miner's console window has the keyboard focus to see the list of the available commands. The
interactive commands are also listed at the end of the following section.

3. Command-line arguments

Note that PhoenixMiner supports most of the command-line options of Claymore's dual Ethereum miner
so you can use the same command line options as the ones you would have used with Claymore's miner.

Pool options:
  -pool <host:port> Ethash pool address
  -wal <wallet> Ethash wallet (some pools require user name and/or worker)
  -pass <password> Ethash password (most pools don't require it, use 'x' as password if unsure)
  -worker <name> Ethash worker name (most pools accept it as part of wallet)
  -proto <n> Selects the kind of stratum protocol for the ethash pool:
     1: miner-proxy stratum spec (e.g. coinotron)
     2: eth-proxy (e.g. dwarfpool, nanopool) - this is the default, works for most pools
     3: qtminer (e.g. ethpool)
     4: EthereumStratum/1.0.0 (e.g. nicehash)
  -coin <coin> Ethash coin to use for devfee to avoid switching DAGs:
     auto: Try to determine from the pool address (default)
     eth: Ethereum
     etc: Ethereum Classic
     exp: Expanse
     music: Musicoin
     ubq: UBIQ
     pirl: Pirl
     ella: Ellaism
     etp: Metaverse ETP
     pgc: Pegascoin
  -stales <n> Submit stales to ethash pool: 1 - yes (default), 0 - no
  -pool2 <host:port>  Failover ethash pool address. Same as -pool but for the failover pool
  -wal2 <wallet> Failover ethash wallet (if missing -wal will be used for the failover pool too)
  -pass2 <password> Failover ethash password (if missing -pass will be used for the failover pool too)
  -worker2 <name> Failover ethash worker name (if missing -worker will be used for the failover pool too)
  -proto2 <n> Failover ethash stratum protocol (if missing -proto will be used for the failover pool too)
  -coin2 <coin> Failover devfee Ethash coin (if missing -coin will be used for the failover pool too)
  -stales2 <n> Submit stales to the failover pool: 1 - yes (default), 0 - no
General pool options:
  -fret <n> Switch to next pool afer N failed connection attempts (default: 3)
  -ftimeout <n> Reconnect if no new ethash job is receved for n seconds (default: 600)
  -ptimeout <n> Switch back to primary pool after n minutes. This setting is 30 minutes by default;
     set to 0 to disable automatic switch back to primary pool.
  -rate <n> Report hashrate to the pool: 1 - yes, 0 - no (1 is the default)
Benchmark mode:
  -bench [<n>],-benchmark [<n>] Benchmark mode, optionally specify DAG epoch. Use this to test your rig.
Remote control options:
  -cdm <n> Selects the level of support of the CDM remote monitoring:
     0: disabled
     1: read-only - this is the default
     2: full (only use on secure connections)
  -cdmport <port> Set the CDM remote monitoring port (default is 3333). You can also specify
     <ip_addr:port> if you have a secure VPN connection and want to bind the CDM port to it
  -cdmpass <pass> Set the CDM remote monitoring password
Mining options:
  -amd  Use only AMD cards
  -nvidia  Use only Nvidia cards
  -gpus <123 ..n> Use only the specified GPUs (if more than 10, separate the indexes with comma)
  -mi <n> Set the mining intensity (0 to 12; 10 is the default)
  -gt <n> Set the GPU tuning parameter (8 to 400). The default is 15. You can change the
          tuning parameter interactively with the '+' and '-' keys in the miner's console window
  -clKernel <n> Type of OpenCL kernel: 0 - generic, 1 - optimized, 2 - alternative (1 is the default)
  -list List the detected GPUs devices and exit
  -minRigSpeed <n> Restart the miner if avg 5 min speed is below <n> MH/s
  -eres <n> Allocate DAG buffers big enough for n epochs ahead (default: 2) to
      avoid allocating new buffers on each DAG epoch switch, which should improve DAG switch stability
  -lidag <n> Slow down DAG generation to avoid crashes when swiching DAG epochs
      (0-3, default: 0 - fastest, 3 - slowest). This option works only on AMD cards
  -altinit Use alternative way to initialize AMD cards to prevent startup crashes
  -wdog <n> Enable watchdog timer: 1 - yes, 0 - no (1 is the default). The watchdog timer checks
      periodically if any of the GPUs freezes and if it does, restarts the miner (see the -rmode
      command-line parameter for the restart modes)
  -rmode <n> Selects the restart mode when a GPU crashes or freezes:
     0: disabled - miner will shut down instead of restarting
     1: restart with the same command line options - this is the default
     2: reboot (shut down miner and execute reboot.bat)
  -log <n> Selects the log file mode:
     0: disabled - no log file will be written
     1: write log file but don't show debug messages on screen (default)
     2: write log file and show debug messages on screen
  -timeout <n> Restart miner according to -rmode after n minutes
General Options:
  -v,--version  Show the version and exit
  -h,--help  Show information about the command-line options and exit
  
Additionally, while the miner is running, you can use the following interactive commands
in the console window by pressing one of these keys:
  s   Print detailed statistics
  1-9 Pause/resume GPU1 ... GPU9
  p   Pause/resume the whole miner
  +,- Increase/decrease GPU tuning parameter
  g   Reset the GPU tuning parameter
  r   Reload epools.txt and switch to primary ethash pool
  e   Select the current ethash pool
  h   Print this short help  

4. Configuration files

Note that PhoenixMiner supports the same configuration files as Claymore's dual Ethereum miner
so you can use your existing configuration files without any changes.

Instead of using command-line options, you can also control PhoenixMiner with configuration
files. If you run PhoenixMiner.exe without any options, it will search for the file config.txt
in the current directory and will read its command-line options from it. If you want, you can
use file with another name by specifying its name as the only command-line option
when running PhoenixMiner.exe.

You will find an example config.txt file in the PhoenixMiner's directory.

Instead of specifying the pool(s) directly on the command line, you can use another configuration
file for this, named epools.txt. There you can specify one pool per line (you will find an example
epools.txt file in the PhoenixMiner's directory).

The advantages of using config.txt and epools.txt files are:
- If you have multiple rigs, you can copy and paste all settings with these files
- If you control your rigs via remote control, you can change pools and even the miner options by
uploading new epools.txt files to the miner, or by uploading new config.txt file and restarting
the miner.

5. Remote monitoring and management

Phoenix miner is fully compatible with Claymore's dual miner protocol for remote monitoring and
management. This means that you can use any tools that are build to support Claymore's dual miner,
including the "Remote manager" application that is part of Claymore's dual miner package.

We are working on much more powerful and secure remote monitoring and control functionality and
control center application, which will allow better control over your remote or local rigs and some
unique features to increase your mining profits.
