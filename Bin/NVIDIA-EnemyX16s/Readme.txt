Also from dk and enemy....if you wish to use reg fix

that regfile stops windows from showing program crash dialog and allows to restart the miner immediately in your bat file if it crashes

You will need to move CcminerRavenEnemypeg.ps1 from this folder and place this file to Miner's Folder.... after you unpack zip file to this folder

Congrats you have enemy miner
